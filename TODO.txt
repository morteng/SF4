# Todo - Next Code Cycle

1. **Template Management**:
   - Ensure all required templates (e.g., `admin/tag/create.html`) exist in the `templates` directory.
   - Verify template paths in controllers and tests.

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Add more tests for `BaseCrudController` to cover edge cases and error scenarios.
   - Increase coverage for other critical components (e.g., `BaseService`, `TagService`).

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Enhance error handling in `BaseCrudController` to log and handle missing templates gracefully.
   - Add specific error messages for template-related issues.

4. **Code Refactoring**:
   - Review and refactor `BaseCrudController` to improve modularity and reusability.
   - Consolidate shared logic into utility functions or base classes.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update inline documentation for `BaseCrudController` and related components.
   - Add docstrings for all public methods and classes.

### Key Insights
1. **Centralization**:
   - Centralized constants improve maintainability.
   - Consistent error messages enhance user experience.

2. **Testing**:
   - Comprehensive testing catches issues early.
   - Mocking is essential for isolating test dependencies.

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Modular code structure makes maintenance easier.
   - Clear error handling improves debugging and user feedback.

### Resolved Issues
1. Fixed missing `INVALID_NAME_CHARACTERS` constant.
2. Updated `BaseCrudController` to handle missing templates gracefully.
3. Mocked `render_template` in tests to avoid dependency on actual template files.
