# Coding step
/ask How can we best implement Code Cycle Step 2 - Coding? Objective: Implement changes based on the analysis. Key Actions: Execute development tasks. Update code files as required. Prepare outputs for testing.

/code Implement suggested changes. Remove any previous console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS_2, add any new console commands you want to run before we go to STEP 3 (Coding). Do not edit files using console commands. Do not run python code using console commands, instead create code files and run them using the "/run your_python_file.py" approach. 

/drop scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_2

# Proceed to console commands for Step 2
/load scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_2
