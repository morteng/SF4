HI! Manager here!

IMPORTANT! You cannot run python code directly with console commands, instead write python files in appropriate folders and then execute them with /run your_python_file.py in the appropriate code block. Take note of this. NEVER run python code directly in code sections of coding cycle.

Key Rules:
1. Run minimal tests per cycle
2. Work on one feature at a time  
3. Avoid debug data dumps
4. Never use manual input commands
5. Keep output concise
6. Verify all changes before deployment
7. Maintain comprehensive documentation

Current Focus:
- Fix Alembic configuration issues
- Resolve pytest import errors
- Implement proper test coverage setup
