# Testing step
/architect How can we best implement Code Cycle Step 3 - Testing? Objective: Validate the changes made during coding. Key Actions: Load testing-specific configurations or logic. Execute tests to verify functionality. Identify and resolve any detected issues. Show edits as unified diffs.

/code Implement suggested changes. Remove any previous console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS_3, add any new console commands you want to run before we go to STEP 4 (Review). Do not edit files using console commands. Do not run python code using console commands, instead create code files and run them using the "/run your_python_file.py" approach. Update TODO list if needed. 

/drop scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_3


# Proceed to console commands for Step 3
/load scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_3
