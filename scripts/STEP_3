/architect How can we best implement Code Cycle Step 3 - Testing? Objective: Validate the changes made during coding. Key Actions: Load testing-specific configurations or logic. Execute tests to verify functionality. Identify and resolve any detected issues. 

/code Implement suggested changes. Remove any previous console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS_3, add any new console commands you want to run before we go to STEP 4 (Review). Update TODO list if needed. Do not explain or summarize, just output the edits.

/drop scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_3


# Proceed to console commands for Step 3
/load scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_3
