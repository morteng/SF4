/add DEVLOG.txt
/architect Code Cycle Step 5 (Final Docs) - Please finalize documentation. Update TODO.txt with final changes, insights & findings as well as a list of actionable todo items for next code cycle. Remove tasks you have completed. Try to keep the todo list as short as possible, conentrate on one part of the project at a time. Consolidate the information in it when possible. Update DEVLOG.txt with a current project status report, a short summary of this code cycle and whatever you think is fitting to put in there. Remove old content and any questions that I have answered. Keep unanswered questions for when I get to them. If you have any additional comments, questions, or concerns for me, your boss, please add them to DEVLOG.txt and keep them there until I have answered them. If there are any priority requests from the CEO, please address them immediately.

# Prompt about console commands

/add scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP5.txt
/code Remove any previously executed console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP5.txt, and add new ones if needed. IMPORTANT: Don't run flask shell or other console commands that stop processing and require manual input to continue. You are not allowed to use such commands or tools. Prepend console commands with /run, e.g. /run flask routes. Do not comment on code or explain yourself, just perform the edit.
