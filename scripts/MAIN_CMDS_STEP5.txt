/architect Code Cycle Step 5 (Final Docs) - Please finalize documentation. Update TODO.txt with final changes, insights & findings as well as a list of actionable todo items for next code cycle. Try to keep the todo list as short as possible, conentrate on one part of the project at a time. Consolidate the information in it when possible. Update DEVLOG.txt with a short summary of this code cycle and whatever you think is fitting to put in there. Remove old content and any questions that I have answered. Keep unanswered questions for when I get to them. If you have any additional comments, questions, or concerns for me, yout boss, please add them to DEVLOG.txt and keep them there until I have answered them.

# Prompt about console commands
/ask Do we need to run any console commands for Step 5?
# If so, we will add them to CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP5.txt. If not, ensure it’s empty or remove old commands.

/add scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP5.txt
/code Remove any previously executed console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP5.txt, and add new ones if needed. IMPORTANT: Don't run flask shell or other console commands that stop processing and require manual input to continue. You are not allowed to use such commands or tools. Prepend console commands with /run, e.g. /run flask shell.
/drop scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP5.txt

# Now load the console commands for Step 5.
