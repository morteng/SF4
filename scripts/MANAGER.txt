### **Instructions**

**General Guidelines:**
1. **Folder and File Operations:** Use temporary scripts to create/move files or folders. Execute them with `/run your_script.py` in the relevant console command step.
2. **Python Execution:** Write Python scripts in proper folders and execute them with `/run your_script.py`. Never run Python code directly in console commands.
3. **Deployment:** Deploy only when:
   - All tests pass.
   - All TODO items are resolved.
   - Explicit CEO approval is received.
4. **Testing:** Perform minimal tests per cycle and maintain concise outputs. No debug data dumps or manual inputs.

### **Current Priorities**

1. **Test Coverage:**
   - Implement module-specific coverage thresholds
   - Add end-to-end admin tests
   - Fix coverage reporting issues

2. **Deployment Preparation:**
   - Verify all environment variables
   - Test deployment rollback procedure
   - Finalize security verification

### **Rules**
- Work on **one feature at a time**.
- **Verify all changes** before deployment.
- Keep **outputs concise** and avoid unnecessary logs or inputs.
- Ensure all configuration values are dynamically loaded from `.env`.
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage for all critical modules.
