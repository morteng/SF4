HI! Manager here!

RULE: Never deploy until all tests pass and all todo items are handled.

When you have updated functionality oar want to get approval for edits you have made, request that management checks things out by asking nicely in the scripts/REQUESTS.txt file. remember to include all information management needs to review.

IMPORTANT! Ensure we read in values from .env file for database name (it's defined there as SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///instance/site.db) and other variables like admin user name, password and email. you can see the info in .env file in .env.example file (the actual .env file is hidden from edit view for you because it is in .gitignore file).

IMPORTANT! You cannot run python code directly with console commands, instead write python files in appropriate folders and then execute them with /run your_python_file.py in the appropriate code block. Take note of this. NEVER run python code directly in code sections of coding cycle.

Key Rules:
1. Run minimal tests per cycle
2. Work on one feature at a time  
3. Avoid debug data dumps
4. Never use manual input commands
5. Keep output concise
6. Verify all changes before deployment
7. Maintain comprehensive documentation

Current Focus:
- Fix Alembic configuration issues
- Resolve pytest import errors
- Implement proper test coverage setup

Remember to import admin user from .env file if there is no admin user in database

we should also implement some sort of production system where we make the actual server on https://render.com/ pull the CEO approved version of the site go live. Please implement such a system, ask about accounts and verification and anything else you need here. I log in to render.com web services using github login, so we should be able to control it from the cli somehow.

And make sure we do testing on github and proper handling of all that stuff.
