# Step 2: Test & Debug


# Step 2 workflow
/ask Code Cycle Step 2 (Test & Debug) - If tests fail, what's causing the issue?
/code implement fixes

# Prompt about console commands
/ask Do we need to run any console commands for Step 2?
# If so, we will add them to CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP2.txt. If not, ensure itâ€™s empty or remove old commands.

/add scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP2.txt
/code Remove any previously executed console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP2.txt, and add new ones if needed. IMPORTANT: Don't run flask shell or other console commands that stop processing and require manual input to continue. You are not allowed to use such commands or tools. Prepend console commands with /run, e.g. /run flask routes.
/drop scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP2.txt

# Now load the console commands for Step 2.
/load scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP2.txt
