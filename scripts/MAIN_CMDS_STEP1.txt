# Step 1 Prompt
/architect Code Cycle Step 1 (Identify & Plan) - Based on TODO.txt and the other docs, how do we address the issues? If I have answered any questions since last time in DEVLOG.txt, incorporate your new knowledge and my desicions into the project files as necessary.

# Prompt about console commands

/add scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP1.txt
/code Remove any previously executed console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP1.txt, and add new ones if needed. IMPORTANT: Don't run flask shell or other console commands that stop processing and require manual input to continue. You are not allowed to use such commands or tools. Prepend console commands with /run, e.g. /run flask routes. Do not comment on code or explain yourself, just perform the edit.
/drop scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP1.txt

# Now load the console commands for Step 1.
/load scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP1.txt
