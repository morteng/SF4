## Testing step
/ask How can we best implement Code Cycle Step 5 - Document and deploy? Objective: Update all documentation and i/o-files like CEO.txt, MANAGER.txt and any others to reflect what we have learned and done this cycle. Deploy the application to the designated environment. Key Actions: Execute deployment tasks. Save updates to the environment. End the cycle and prepare for the next iteration. 

/code Implement suggested changes. Remove any previous console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS_5, add any new console commands you want to run before we reset and return to STEP 1. Ready to depoy? Tell management in the scripts/REQUESTS.txt file and ask them do do it. Never publish to main without explicit permission from MANAGER.txt. Do not edit files using console commands. Do not run python code using console commands, instead create code files and run them using the "/run your_python_file.py" approach. Do not explain or summarize, just output the edits.
