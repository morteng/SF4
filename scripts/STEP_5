## Testing step
/ask How can we best implement Code Cycle Step 5 - Document, demo and deploy? Objective: Update all documentation such as README.md. DESIGN.md, PROGRESS.md, PRD.md, and i/o-files like CEO.txt, MANAGER.txt and any others. Incorporate instructions you find into project documentation and remove them from the instruction file afterwards. Are you ready to demo the app? Run it. Remove completed items from TODO. Evaluate deplyment readiness. What else must be done now?

/code Choose the best way forward. Implement suggested changes. Remove any previous console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS_5, add any new console commands you want to run before we reset and return to Step 1. Deploy if ready. Push to github when appropriate. Do not edit files using console commands. Do not run python code using console commands, instead create code files and run them using the "/run your_python_file.py" approach. Only edit the parts between code start and code end, don't do anything too ambitious, simple console commands only.
