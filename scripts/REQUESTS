Dear Manager,

We have completed all development and testing tasks for this cycle. The application is ready for deployment to production. Please review and approve the following deployment steps:

1. Create production database backup
2. Validate production schema
3. Archive logs
4. Verify deployment

All changes have been tested and verified. Please let us know if you need any additional information or if we should proceed with deployment.

Thank you,
Development Team


MANAGER: hello, things are looking good, keep up the good work! you can push to github when you want

we should also implement some sort of production system where we make the actual server on https://render.com/ pull the CEO approved version of the site go live. Please implement such a system, ask about accounts and verification and anything else you need here.
