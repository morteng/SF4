# Step 3 workflow
/ask Code Cycle Step 3 (Refine & Summarize) - Should we revisit or refactor any code? Summarize the current status.
/architect implement improvements
/test

# Prompt about console commands
/ask Do we need to run any console commands for Step 3?
# If so, we will add them to CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP3.txt. If not, ensure it’s empty or remove old commands.

/add scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP3.txt
/code Remove any previously executed console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP3.txt, and add new ones if needed. IMPORTANT: Don't run flask shell or other console commands that stop processing and require manual input to continue. You are not allowed to use such commands or tools. 
/drop scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP3.txt

# Now load the console commands for Step 3.
/load scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP3.txt
