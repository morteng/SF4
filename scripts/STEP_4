## Testing step
/ask How can we best implement Code Cycle Step 4 - Review? Objective: Perform a final review before deployment. Key Actions: Ensure all implemented changes are correct and documented. Finalize updates and gather review notes. Confirm readiness for deployment. 

/code Implement suggested changes. Remove any previous console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS_4, add any new console commands you want to run before we go to STEP 5 (Deployment). Do not edit files using console commands. Do not run python code using console commands, instead create code files and run them using the "/run your_python_file.py" approach. 

/drop scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_4

# Proceed to console commands for Step 4
/load scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_4
