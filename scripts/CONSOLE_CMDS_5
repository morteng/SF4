Delete DEVLOG.md and replace it with a new DEVLOG.md based on this cycle. Include code cycle number, cycle processing time and test coverage stats. Add requests for any actions that are impossible for you to do to REQUESTS.txt. Update TODO list if needed, removing items that have been verified as completed. Keep documentation as compact as possible, prune and remove what you can without losing important information.
