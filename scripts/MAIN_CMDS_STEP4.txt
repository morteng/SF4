# Prompt about console commands
/add scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP4.txt
/code Remove any previously executed console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP4.txt, and add new ones if needed. IMPORTANT: Don't run flask shell or other console commands that stop processing and require manual input to continue. You are not allowed to use such commands or tools. Prepend console commands with /run, e.g. /run flask routes. Do not comment on code or explain yourself, just perform the edit.
/drop scripts/CONSOLE_CMDS_STEP4.txt

# Now load the console commands for Step 4.
