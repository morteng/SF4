# Code Cycle Summary - Stipend Creation Fixes

## Changes Implemented:
1. Updated CustomDateTimeField to handle error messages properly
2. Improved error handling in stipend creation route
3. Added session verification tests
4. Updated documentation and test coverage

## Key Insights:
1. Session management is critical for authentication flows
2. Form validation errors need to be handled consistently
3. Comprehensive testing helps identify edge cases

## Resolved Issues:
1. Fixed session verification in test cases
2. Improved error handling in stipend creation flow
3. Added better test coverage for authentication

## Open Questions:
1. Should we implement a more sophisticated form validation system? Just get them working, i don't care.
2. Are there any additional edge cases we should test for authentication? I leave this up to you.

## Next Steps:
1. Finalize form validation implementation
2. Add comprehensive authentication tests
3. Improve error handling consistency across all routes

## Additional Comments:
- The CustomDateTimeField implementation needs final review
- Authentication flow tests should be expanded
- Consider adding integration tests for end-to-end flows
