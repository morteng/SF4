# Code Cycle Summary - Stipend Form Fixes

## Current Status:
- Added missing 'name' field to StipendForm
- Test_create_stipend_invalid_characters still failing
- Test coverage at 47%
- All routes properly registered and validated

## Root Cause Analysis:
1. Form initialization still failing despite field addition
2. Potential issue with form instantiation in route
3. Need to verify form field inheritance chain

## Immediate Priorities:
1. Debug form initialization in stipend route
2. Verify form field inheritance
3. Add form initialization logging

## Changes Implemented:
1. Added 'name' field to StipendForm with validators
2. Simplified console commands for testing
3. Updated DEVLOG with current status

## Next Steps:
1. Add debug logging to stipend route
2. Verify form field inheritance chain
3. Add form initialization tests

### Key Insights:
1. **Form Initialization**:
   - Need to verify form instantiation in route
   - Should add debug logging for form fields
2. **Testing**:
   - Need more comprehensive form initialization tests
   - Should add edge case coverage for form validation
3. **Code Quality**:
   - Form field inheritance needs verification
   - Template system needs better error handling

### Decisions:
1. Add debug logging to stipend route - YES
2. Verify form field inheritance - YES
3. Add form initialization tests - YES
