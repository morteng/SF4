# Code Cycle Summary - Blueprint Validation & Route Registration

## Changes Implemented:
1. Fixed blueprint registration validation
2. Added BaseBlueprint class with built-in validation
3. Enhanced error handling and logging
4. Updated tests for blueprint validation

## Key Insights:
1. Blueprint names must follow consistent naming conventions
2. Route validation requires exact endpoint names
3. Detailed error messages improve debugging efficiency

## Resolved Issues:
1. Fixed missing routes error (admin.stipend.create)
2. Improved blueprint registration flow
3. Added debug logging for route validation

## Next Steps:
1. Implement BaseBlueprint across all blueprints
2. Add health check endpoint and route monitoring
3. Standardize error handling and logging

## Questions/Concerns:
1. Should we implement a more sophisticated route monitoring system?
2. Would you like to prioritize any specific area for the next code cycle?
