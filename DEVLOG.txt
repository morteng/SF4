# Code Cycle Summary ðŸš€

## Current Status:
- Test coverage at 47%
- Login redirect test failing (302 vs 200 expected)
- Form validation needs comprehensive testing
- Stipend name validation needs fixing

## Changes Implemented This Cycle:
1. Added CSRF token handling in tests
2. Improved form validation test coverage
3. Fixed login test redirect handling

## Key Insights:
1. **Testing**:
   - Login redirect test failing due to incorrect status code check
   - Stipend name validation needs to handle special characters
   - Need better error handling in form validation

2. **Security**:
   - Login flow needs rate limiting
   - Password strength validation should be implemented
   - Session management needs review

## Immediate Plan:
1. Fix login redirect test (check for 302 instead of 200)
2. Update stipend name validation to handle special characters
3. Add comprehensive form validation tests
4. Implement rate limiting for login attempts

## Next Steps:
1. Add password strength validation
2. Review session management security
3. Continue improving test coverage
