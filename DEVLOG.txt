2. Verified field rendering works correctly
3. Updated test coverage metrics

## Key Insights:
1. **Custom Field Implementation**:
   - _value() method is now properly implemented
   - Field rendering works as expected
2. **Testing**:
   - Login flow needs better redirect handling
   - Need more comprehensive form validation tests
3. **Code Quality**:
   - Custom field implementation is stable

### Open Questions:
1. Should we add more validation for special characters in stipend names?
   - Decision: Yes, but only basic validation to prevent SQL injection
2. Do we need additional error handling for form submissions?
   - Decision: Yes, better error messages for invalid inputs

### Priority Tasks:
1. Fix login test assertions (immediate)
2. Add form validation tests
3. Review test coverage for edge cases
