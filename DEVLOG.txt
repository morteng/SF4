# Code Cycle Summary - Stipend Form Validation

## Project current status report
- Stipend form rendering still failing due to missing 'name' field
- Login and basic blueprint tests passing
- Coverage at 48% overall

## Changes Implemented:
1. Refactored StipendForm field initialization
2. Added detailed form field validation
3. Improved test coverage for invalid character handling

## Key Insights:
1. **Form Initialization**:
   - WTForms fields must be defined at class level
   - Dynamic field creation in __init__ doesn't work with templates
2. **Testing**:
   - Need better error handling in form initialization
   - Template rendering tests are essential

## Next Steps:
1. Fix form field initialization
2. Add template rendering tests
3. Improve coverage for edge cases

### Additional Questions:
1. Should we add form validation helper methods?
2. Do we need to add more template-specific tests?
