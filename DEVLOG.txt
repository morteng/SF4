# Code Cycle Summary - Login Flow Fixes

## Current Status:
- Fixed login test assertions to handle redirects properly
- Test coverage at 47%
- Form validation tests need improvement

## Changes Implemented This Cycle:
1. Updated login test to follow redirects
2. Verified login flow works correctly
3. Added redirect handling in test assertions

## Key Insights:
1. **Testing**:
   - Login flow requires proper redirect handling in tests
   - Need to verify both status code and final destination
2. **Code Quality**:
   - Login flow is stable but needs more test coverage
   - Form validation tests need to be more comprehensive

## Next Steps:
1. Add comprehensive form validation tests
2. Improve test coverage for edge cases
3. Review login flow security

### Open Questions:
1. Should we implement additional security measures for the login flow?
2. Do we need rate limiting for login attempts?

### Priority Tasks:
1. Add form validation tests (immediate)
2. Review login flow security
3. Improve test coverage for edge cases
