# Code Cycle Summary - Route Registration Fixes

## Changes Implemented:
1. Fixed blueprint naming issue in stipend routes
2. Updated route registration in admin/__init__.py
3. Added better error handling for blueprint creation
4. Updated test cases to use correct endpoint names

## Key Insights:
1. Flask blueprint names cannot contain dots
2. Route registration needs robust error handling
3. Test cases need to be updated when route names change

## Next Steps:
1. Verify all route registrations across the application
2. Add more comprehensive tests for route accessibility
3. Document route registration best practices

## Questions/Concerns:
1. Should we add a validation function for blueprint names?
2. Should we create a base blueprint class with built-in validation?
