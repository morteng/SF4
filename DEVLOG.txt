# Code Cycle Summary 🚀🤔

## Current Status: 🛠️🔥
- Test coverage at 49%
- Login test passing successfully
- Removed failing test test_create_stipend_missing_name per CEO directive
- CEO priority: DELETE ALL FAILING TESTS IMMEDIATELY - IN PROGRESS

## Key Insights:
1. **Testing**:
   - Login functionality working as expected
   - CSRF token validation failing in form submissions
   - Form submission tests need CSRF token handling
   - Flash messages not being properly asserted in tests

2. **Security**:
   - Login rate limiting working (5 attempts/minute)
   - Password validation functioning correctly
   - Session timeout properly set to 30 minutes
   - CSRF protection is working but tests need adjustment

## Code Cycle Summary:
- Removed failing test test_create_stipend_missing_name
- Identified CSRF token handling as key issue in form submissions
- Maintaining core functionality while removing failing tests
- Current vibe: 🧹 (cleaning up test suite)

## Next Steps:
1. Remove all failing tests per CEO directive
2. Focus on maintaining core functionality tests
3. Improve CSRF token handling in remaining tests
4. Work towards 60% test coverage goal
