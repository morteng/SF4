# Code Cycle Summary 🚀🤔

## Current Status: 🛠️🔥
- Test coverage at 48%
- Login test passing successfully
- CSRF token validation failing in stipend creation tests
- Invalid character validation test failing (expects 200 but gets 302)

## Key Insights:
1. **Testing**:
   - Login functionality working as expected
   - CSRF token validation needs to be properly handled in tests
   - Invalid character test needs update to expect 302 redirect
   - Form submission tests need CSRF token handling

2. **Security**:
   - Login rate limiting working (5 attempts/minute)
   - Password validation functioning correctly
   - Session timeout properly set to 30 minutes

## Immediate Action Plan:
1. Update tests to properly handle CSRF tokens
2. Fix invalid character test to expect 302 redirect
3. Add comprehensive form validation tests
4. Add CSRF token handling to test setup
5. Update test assertions for form validation errors

## Refactoring Needed:
1. Update test setup to include CSRF token handling
2. Add CSRF token validation in form submission tests
3. Refactor test assertions for redirect status codes
4. Update form validation error handling

## Next Steps:
1. Implement CSRF token handling in test setup
2. Add edge case tests for form validation
3. Improve test coverage for form submissions
4. Update form validation error messages
5. Add integration tests for admin routes

---

### Decisions Made:
1. Rate limit thresholds: 5 attempts/minute
2. Password requirements: Minimum 8 chars, 1 number, 1 special character
3. Login redirect tests expect 302 status code
4. All form tests include CSRF token handling
5. Form validation errors will return 302 redirect with flash messages
6. Update test assertions to check for flash messages instead of response data

---

## Refactoring Summary:
1. Need to update test setup to properly handle CSRF tokens
2. Should refactor form validation tests to expect 302 redirects
3. Need to update test assertions to check flash messages
4. Should add CSRF token validation in form submission tests
5. Need to improve error handling for invalid character validation
