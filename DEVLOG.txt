# Code Cycle Summary ðŸš€

## Current Status:
- Test coverage at 47%
- Login redirect handling needs adjustment
- Form validation needs comprehensive testing

## Changes Implemented This Cycle:
1. Added CSRF token handling in tests
2. Improved form validation test coverage
3. Fixed login test redirect handling

## Key Insights:
1. **Testing**:
   - Need proper redirect handling in authentication tests
   - CSRF tokens must be handled in all form submissions
   - Comprehensive validation tests are critical for security

2. **Security**:
   - Login flow needs rate limiting
   - Password strength validation should be implemented
   - Session management needs review

## Next Steps:
1. Implement rate limiting for login attempts
2. Add password strength validation
3. Review session management security
4. Continue improving test coverage

### Open Questions:
1. What should be the rate limit thresholds for login attempts?
2. What password strength requirements should we implement?

### Priority Tasks:
1. Implement login rate limiting (immediate)
2. Add password strength validation
3. Review session management
4. Continue improving test coverage
