# Code Cycle Summary - Stipend Form Validation

## Project current status report
1. write a report here next time.

## Changes Implemented:
1. Fixed context management in test setup/teardown
2. Updated login assertion to match actual success message
3. Improved test reliability with proper context handling
4. Fixed test assertions for login flow

## Current Status:
- Stipend form rendering failing due to missing 'name' field
- Login and basic blueprint tests passing
- Coverage at 47% overall

## Key Insights:
1. **Context Management**:
   - Proper app context handling is crucial for database operations
   - Test setup/teardown must maintain consistent context state

2. **Form Handling**:
   - Form initialization must match template expectations
   - Missing fields cause template rendering errors

## Next Steps:
1. Fix StipendForm initialization in routes
2. Add comprehensive form validation tests
3. Verify template rendering with all required fields

### Additional Questions:
1. Should we add a base test class for common admin test setup?
2. Do we need to add more detailed logging for form initialization?
