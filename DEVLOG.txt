# Code Cycle Summary 🚀🤔

## Current Status: 🛠️🔥
- Test coverage at 48%
- Login redirect test fixed (now expects 302)
- test_login method implemented and passing
- CSRF token validation still failing in stipend creation tests
- Invalid character validation test failing (expects 200 but gets 302)

## Key Insights:
1. **Testing**:
   - Login redirects now properly handled (expect 302)
   - CSRF token handling needs improvement in form tests
   - Comprehensive validation tests still needed
   - Invalid character test needs update to expect 302 redirect

2. **Security**:
   - Login rate limiting implemented (5 attempts/minute)
   - Password strength validation working
   - Session timeout set to 30 minutes

## Immediate Action Plan:
1. Fix invalid character test to expect 302 redirect
2. Add comprehensive form validation tests
3. Continue improving test coverage

## Refactoring Needed:
1. Update stipend creation tests to properly handle CSRF
2. Add validation for special characters in stipend names

## Next Steps:
1. Fix CSRF token handling in form tests
2. Add edge case tests for form validation
3. Implement integration tests for form submissions

---

### Decisions Made:
1. Rate limit thresholds: 5 attempts/minute
2. Password requirements: Minimum 8 chars, 1 number, 1 special character
3. Login redirect tests expect 302 status code
4. All form tests include CSRF token handling
