# Code Cycle Summary - Stipend Form Validation

## Current Status:
- Fixed duplicate enum definition in constants.py
- Tests still failing due to form initialization issues
- Coverage at 48% overall

## Changes Implemented:
1. Removed duplicate INVALID_NAME_CHARACTERS definition
2. Cleaned up FlashMessages enum in constants.py

## Key Insights:
1. **Constants Management**:
   - Need better organization of error messages
   - Should implement validation for enum uniqueness
2. **Form Initialization**:
   - WTForms fields must be properly initialized
   - Need better error handling for form rendering

## Next Steps:
1. Fix form field initialization
2. Add template rendering tests
3. Improve coverage for edge cases

### Additional Questions:
1. Should we add form validation helper methods?
2. Do we need to add more template-specific tests?
