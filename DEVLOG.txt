# Code Cycle Summary - Route Registration & Validation

## Changes Implemented:
1. Fixed blueprint naming and route registration issues
2. Added application context handling for route validation
3. Improved error logging and debugging
4. Updated documentation with best practices

## Key Insights:
1. Application context is crucial when accessing `current_app`
2. Debug logging helps identify route registration issues
3. Consistent naming conventions prevent validation errors

## Next Steps:
1. Add route monitoring and health checks
2. Implement enum validation
3. Update API documentation

## Questions/Concerns:
1. Should we create a base blueprint class with built-in validation?
2. How can we improve route monitoring and alerting?
