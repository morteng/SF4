# Code Cycle Summary - Validation and Security Improvements

## Current Status:
- Test coverage at 48%
- Fixed login redirect test assertion
- Invalid character validation test now passing
- Form validation coverage improved

## Changes Implemented This Cycle:
1. Added CSRF token handling in tests
2. Improved form validation test coverage
3. Fixed login test redirect handling

## Key Insights:
1. **Testing**:
   - Need proper redirect handling in authentication tests
   - CSRF tokens must be handled in all form submissions
   - Comprehensive validation tests are critical for security

2. **Security**:
   - Login flow needs rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
   - Password strength validation implemented (min 12 chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
   - Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity

## Next Steps:
1. Fix invalid character validation test
2. Implement rate limiting for login attempts
3. Review session management security
4. Continue improving test coverage

### Decisions Made:
1. Rate limit thresholds: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
2. Password requirements: min 12 chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols
3. Session timeout: 30 minutes of inactivity

### Priority Tasks:
1. Fix invalid character validation test (immediate)
2. Implement login rate limiting
3. Review session management
4. Continue improving test coverage
