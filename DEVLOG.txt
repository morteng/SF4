# Code Cycle Summary 🚀🤔

## Current Status: 🛠️
- Test coverage at 48%
- Login redirect test failing (302 vs 200)
- Missing test_login method in AdminStipendTestCase
- Form validation needs comprehensive testing

## Key Insights:
1. **Testing**:
   - Login redirects need proper handling in tests
   - CSRF tokens must be handled in all form submissions
   - Comprehensive validation tests are critical for security
   - Missing test methods need to be implemented

2. **Security**:
   - Login flow needs rate limiting (5 attempts/minute)
   - Password strength validation implemented (min 8 chars, 1 number, 1 special char)
   - Session timeout set to 30 minutes

## Next Steps:
1. Implement missing test_login method
2. Fix failing login redirect test
3. Add comprehensive form validation tests
4. Implement login rate limiting
5. Continue improving test coverage

### Decisions Made:
1. Rate limit thresholds: 5 attempts/minute
2. Password requirements: Minimum 8 chars, 1 number, 1 special character
