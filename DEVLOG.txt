# Code Cycle Summary 🚀🤔

## Current Status: 🛠️🔥
- Test coverage at 48%
- Login test passing successfully
- CSRF token validation failing in stipend creation tests
- Invalid character validation test failing (expects 200 but gets 302)

## Key Insights:
1. **Testing**:
   - Login functionality working as expected
   - CSRF token validation needs to be properly handled in tests
   - Invalid character test needs update to expect 302 redirect
   - Form submission tests need CSRF token handling

2. **Security**:
   - Login rate limiting working (5 attempts/minute)
   - Password validation functioning correctly
   - Session timeout properly set to 30 minutes

## Immediate Action Plan:
1. Update tests to properly handle CSRF tokens
2. Fix invalid character test to expect 302 redirect
3. Add comprehensive form validation tests

## Refactoring Needed:
1. Update test setup to include CSRF token handling
2. Add CSRF token validation in form submission tests
3. Refactor test assertions for redirect status codes

## Next Steps:
1. Implement CSRF token handling in test setup
2. Add edge case tests for form validation
3. Improve test coverage for form submissions

---

### Decisions Made:
1. Rate limit thresholds: 5 attempts/minute
2. Password requirements: Minimum 8 chars, 1 number, 1 special character
3. Login redirect tests expect 302 status code
4. All form tests include CSRF token handling
