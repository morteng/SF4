# Code Cycle Summary - Constants and Form Validation Fixes

## Changes Implemented:
1. Fixed duplicate INVALID_NAME_CHARACTERS constant definition
2. Updated form validation to use consistent error messages
3. Added test coverage for constant usage
4. Improved error handling in form validation

## Key Insights:
1. Centralized constants improve maintainability
2. Consistent error messages enhance user experience
3. Comprehensive testing catches duplicate definitions

## Resolved Issues:
1. Removed duplicate constant definition
2. Fixed form validation error message handling
3. Added test coverage for constant usage

## Next Steps:
1. Verify all forms use centralized constants
2. Add integration tests for end-to-end form validation
3. Review other constants for potential duplicates

## Additional Comments:
- The form validation system is now more robust
- Centralized constants make future changes easier
- Consider adding a linter to catch duplicate definitions
