# Code Cycle Summary - Stipend Form Validation

## Project current status report
- Stipend form rendering fixed with proper field definitions
- Login and basic blueprint tests passing
- Coverage at 52% overall

## Changes Implemented:
1. Added base AdminTest class for common setup
2. Implemented detailed form initialization logging
3. Added comprehensive form validation tests

## Key Insights:
1. **Form Initialization**:
   - WTForms requires fields to be defined at class level
   - Field initialization in __init__ causes template rendering errors
2. **Testing**:
   - Base test class reduces code duplication
   - Detailed logging helps debug form issues

## Next Steps:
1. Add template rendering tests
2. Improve coverage for edge cases
3. Document form validation patterns

### Additional Questions:
1. Should we add form validation helper methods?
2. Do we need to add more template-specific tests?
