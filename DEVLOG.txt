   - Clear validation feedback enhances user experience

3. **Testing**:
   - Need better test coverage for edge cases
   - Missing templates cause test failures

## Resolved Issues:
1. Fixed CSRF_ERROR constant conflict
2. Updated test assertions to use centralized constants
3. Improved validation error handling

## Next Steps:
1. Create missing admin templates
2. Enhance test coverage for edge cases
3. Implement base template for admin CRUD operations
