# Code Cycle Summary - Blueprint Registration Fixes

## Changes Implemented:
1. Fixed blueprint naming convention issues
2. Enhanced route registration validation
3. Improved error handling and logging
4. Updated documentation and tests

## Key Insights:
1. Blueprint names cannot contain dots (.)
2. Consistent endpoint naming is crucial for validation
3. Detailed logging helps identify registration issues

## Resolved Issues:
1. Fixed missing routes error (admin_stipend.create, admin_dashboard.dashboard)
2. Improved blueprint registration flow
3. Added debug logging for route validation

## Next Steps:
1. Implement route monitoring and health checks
2. Add enum validation
3. Consolidate error handling

## Questions/Concerns:
1. Should we create a base blueprint class with built-in validation?
2. Would you like to implement a more sophisticated route monitoring system?
