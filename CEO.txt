Hi! CEO HERE! I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND, WORK ON FIXING TESTS. THIS IS TOP PRIORITY. THIS SUPERSEDES ANY PREVIOUS PRIORITY REQUESTS! THANK YOU.

HI! CEO HERE AGAIN. If you create new test files, make sure they are modular for easy maiatenance and in a logical folder structure under tests/ add this to conventions file or other part of docmentation if appropriate. Move the test files in tests folder to logical subfolders, make them modlar with logical file names and in neat subfolder structre. THANK YOU!
