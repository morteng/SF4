# Project Diary

## Week 1 Summary
- Completed comprehensive error handling implementation for stipend routes
- Implemented consistent error message formatting using format_error_message utility
- Added field-specific error rendering in templates with proper container structure
- Developed robust date validation with edge case handling
- Established testing patterns for error handling verification
- Standardized error handling across all admin routes

Key Accomplishments:
- Implemented validation for all form fields in stipend routes
- Added comprehensive date validation with specific error messages
- Created test coverage for all error scenarios in test_stipend_htmx.py
- Established consistent error container structure (#<field_name>-error)
- Implemented proper HTMX response handling for error cases

Key Learnings:
- Error messages must match exactly between client and server
- Template structure must align with test expectations
- Field-specific error containers improve test reliability
- Comprehensive date validation requires checking all components
- Error message mapping improves consistency and maintainability
- Detailed test assertions help catch edge cases

## Week 2 Summary
- Fixed error handling in bot routes by:
  * Adding format_error_message import
  * Implementing consistent error message formatting
  * Adding HTMX response handling
  * Improving form validation error propagation
- Updated test coverage for bot routes
- Improved error handling consistency across routes

Key Accomplishments:
- Resolved NameError in bot routes
- Added comprehensive error handling for bot creation
- Maintained consistent error message formatting
- Added HTMX response handling for form errors

Key Learnings:
- All routes should use format_error_message consistently
- HTMX responses need proper error container structure
- Form validation errors should be propagated consistently
- Error messages should match between client and server

## Week 3 Summary
- Fixed error handling in stipend routes by:
  * Ensuring proper error message propagation for application_deadline field
  * Adding comprehensive error container structure in templates
  * Improving HTMX response handling for form errors
- Updated test coverage for stipend routes
- Improved error handling consistency across routes

Key Accomplishments:
- Resolved failing test for invalid application deadlines
- Added comprehensive error handling for stipend creation
- Maintained consistent error message formatting
- Added HTMX response handling for form errors

Key Learnings:
- Error messages must be properly propagated to templates

- Form validation errors should be handled consistently
- Error messages should match between client and server

## Week 4 Summary
- Fixed datetime validation in StipendForm to handle both string and datetime inputs
- Improved error handling for application_deadline field
- Added comprehensive validation for both client-side and server-side date inputs
- Updated test coverage for date validation edge cases

Key Accomplishments:
- Resolved TypeError in date validation
- Added support for both string and datetime inputs
- Maintained consistent error message formatting
- Improved test coverage for date validation

Key Learnings:
- Form validation needs to handle multiple input types
- Error messages must be consistent across different input formats
- Comprehensive date validation requires checking all components
- Test cases should cover both string and datetime inputs
