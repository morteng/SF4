# MEMORY BANK

Current Iteration: 47

Context: Resolving circular imports and configuration issues
Known Issues:
- Circular import between routes/admin and common/utils via BaseBlueprint
- Duplicate logging configuration in utils.py and logging_config.py
- Potential configuration validation gaps

Recent Changes:
- Moved BaseBlueprint to common/base_blueprint.py
- Consolidated logging configuration in logging_config.py
- Removed logging setup from utils.py

Next Steps:
- Verify circular import fix by running flask routes
- Test logging configuration consistency
- Implement configuration validation in config.py
- Check for any remaining circular dependencies
- Ensure all tests pass after changes
- Proceed with configuration cleanup
- Finalize controller consolidation
- Conduct full test suite verification
