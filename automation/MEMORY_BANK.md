Current Iteration: 44

Context: Resolving model inheritance and circular import issues
Known Issues:
- Circular imports in model files
- Redundant base classes causing conflicts
- Some models still referencing old base class

Recent Changes:
- Removed redundant base.py
- Updated model imports to use BaseModel
- Fixed circular dependencies in imports

Next Steps:
- Verify all models inherit from BaseModel
- Ensure no remaining references to old base classes
- Test the application thoroughly
- Continue with configuration consolidation
- Finalize controller consolidation
- Conduct full test suite verification
