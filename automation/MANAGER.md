Just try to get something, an MVP, up and running, before starting building out the frontend where users get asked questions and select appropriate tags to narrow down to a set of relevant stipends that are appropriate for the user. we also need systems to build the questions.

FEATURE REQUEST: Ensure dashboard has stats and values for monitoring metrics and other relevant info.

Important info: There is an .env file even tho you cannot see it. It is identical to the .env.example file in the project root folder.
