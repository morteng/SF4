### Info from management

i see from logs that you're setting paths like this:


Executing: /run scripts/verification/verify_production_ready.py
Added to Python path: C:\github
Added to Python path: C:\github\app
Added to Python path: C:\github\scripts
Added to Python path: C:\github\SF4\scripts
Added to Python path: C:\github\scripts\verification
Added to Python path: C:\github\scripts\testing
Added to Python path: C:\github\scripts\startup

These paths are WRONG - actual project root on dev machinge is c:\github\SF4\
We must detect and set paths correctly and properly, not try hardcoding project root, that will not be the same when we push to production.
