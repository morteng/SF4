### Info from management

IMPORTANT: When creating stipends in admin interface and when bots do it, only stipend name is obligatory - all other fields can be left empty. Please make note of this in docs and refactor code.

IMPORTANT: All buttons in admin interface (create stipend and so on) must reload entire page, otherwise we get double top nav menus.

0. **End-to-end integration testing**
   - Test all CRUD operations on Stipends, tags, orgs and so on from login to creation and deletion - using the HTMX admin web interface. This must be done and prove 100% before we attempt to run the app again (or deploy)

1. **Post-Deployment Monitoring:**
   - Monitor system performance metrics
   - Review error logs daily
   - Verify backups weekly

2. **User Feedback Collection:**
   - Implement user feedback surveys
   - Analyze usage patterns
   - Identify improvement areas

3. **Maintenance Schedule:**
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Review monitoring alerts
   - Maintain test coverage
