### Info from management

IMPORTANT BUG FIX! I see from the logs that you're adding these to python path:
Added to Python path: C:\github
Added to Python path: C:\github\app
Added to Python path: C:\github\scripts
Added to Python path: C:\github\tests
Added to Python path: C:\github\SF4\.venv\Lib\site-packages

Clearly the correct paths should all be C:\github\SF4\... since SF4 is project root folder. So C:\github\appshould be C:\github\SF4\app and so on.

I have tested the admin interface. Stipends management is not working.

0. **End-to-end integration testing**
   - Test all CRUD operations on Stipends, tags, orgs and so on from login to creation and deletion - using the HTMX admin web interface. This must be done and prove 100% before we attempt to run the app again (or deploy)

1. **Post-Deployment Monitoring:**
   - Monitor system performance metrics
   - Review error logs daily
   - Verify backups weekly

2. **User Feedback Collection:**
   - Implement user feedback surveys
   - Analyze usage patterns
   - Identify improvement areas

3. **Maintenance Schedule:**
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Review monitoring alerts
   - Maintain test coverage

### **Rules**
- Maintain 85%+ test coverage
- Integration testing of all admin functionality
- Conduct daily system health checks
- Perform weekly security reviews
- Plan next development cycle
