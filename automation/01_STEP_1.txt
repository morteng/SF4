/ask How can we best implement Code Cycle Step 1 - Analysis? Any console output already present is the latest output from the app. Read the PRD for requirements, check design doc for the current architecture, and refer to the planning doc for ongoing progress. Instructions in MANAGER.txt have top priority. Key Actions:  - Review project documentation and context  - Perform problem analysis and planning  - Prepare for necessary file updates. Think step by step.


# Next, propose code updates, focusing on analysis-related changes. 
/architect Choose the best way forward based on the analysis.  - Implement any new ideas or directions suggested by MANAGER.txt  - Update files if necessary  - Remove any previously used console commands from 02_CONSOLE_CMDS_1.txt  - Add new console commands you want to run before Step 2  - Do not run Python code directly with console commands; create or update .py files, then /run them. 

# Step 1 over, go to 02_CONSOLE_CMDS_1.txt
