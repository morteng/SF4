# Console Commands for Step 5 (Document, Pre-Demo)
# Only edit the section between CODE START and CODE END - always run scripts using python, e.g. /run python scripts/myscript.py

### CODE START ###

# Re-run user model tests with correct filter (verify test now runs and passes)
/run python -m pytest tests/test_user_model.py -k security_columns -v

# Re-verify database schema (ensure schema is still valid)
/run python scripts/verification/verify_db_schema.py --full-check

# Documentation updates (DEVLOG, TODO) - MANUAL STEP - remember to do this!
# No automatic commands for documentation updates in this step.

### CODE END ###

/load automation/11_FINAL_CLEANUP.txt
# (Rest of the file remains as is - cleanup, final docs, approval, commit - these will be revisited later when tests pass)
