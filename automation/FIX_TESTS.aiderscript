### EDITABLE AREA STARTS ###
# Fix circular imports
/run python scripts/fix_imports.py

# Fix logging configuration
/run python scripts/fix_logging.py

# Verify fixes
/run flask routes
/run pytest -v

# Continue with configuration consolidation
/architect let's fix the problems. How can we further consolidate logging and configuration files? Are there any remaining circular imports or duplicated code?

### EDITABLE AREA ENDS ###


### DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE! ###


/add automation\FIX_TESTS.aiderscript
/architect this has been a run of the script file FIX_TESTS.aiderscript. Given the results of this run, make any edits you need to automation\FIX_TESTS.aiderscript in preperation for the next run, changing only the section defined as editable (between editable area starts and editable area ends). If you need to run any console commands, prepend them with /run. This is a windows 10 machine, you are running in a powershell. If you need to run any code, first create or edit the script in scripts/ folder, then run it next iteration with /run python scripts/myscript.py. 

/architect Update automation\MEMORY_BANK.md with any information you need in the next run, documenting current state. The working memory context will reset before next iteration, so this is your chance to remember important information. 

/architect Update any other documentation if you need to.


/reset
