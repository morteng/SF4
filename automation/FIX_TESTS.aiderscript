### EDITABLE AREA STARTS ###

### MEMORY BANK STARTS ###

Current Iteration: 48

Context: Resolving circular imports and configuration issues
Known Issues:
- Circular import between routes/admin and common/utils via BaseBlueprint
- Duplicate logging configuration in utils.py and logging_config.py
- Potential configuration validation gaps
• Flask routes command failed due to config loading issue
• Test import error: No module named 'app.controllers.base_crud_controller'

Recent Changes:
- Moved BaseBlueprint to common/base_blueprint.py
- Consolidated logging configuration in logging_config.py
- Removed logging setup from utils.py

Next Steps:
- Verify circular import fix by running flask routes
- Test logging configuration consistency
- Implement configuration validation in config.py
- Check for any remaining circular dependencies
- Ensure all tests pass after changes
- Proceed with configuration cleanup
- Finalize controller consolidation
- Conduct full test suite verification

### MEMORY BANK ENDS ###


# Fix circular imports
/run python scripts/fix_imports.py

# Fix logging configuration
/run python scripts/fix_logging.py

# Verify fixes
/run flask routes
/run pytest -v

# Continue with configuration consolidation
/architect let's fix the problems. How can we further consolidate logging and configuration files? Are there any remaining circular imports or duplicated code?

### EDITABLE AREA ENDS ###


### DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE! ###


/add automation\FIX_TESTS.aiderscript
/architect this has been a run of the script file FIX_TESTS.aiderscript. Given the results of this run, make any edits you need to automation\FIX_TESTS.aiderscript in preperation for the next run, changing only the section defined as editable (between editable area starts and editable area ends). If you need to run any console commands, prepend them with /run. This is a windows 10 machine, you are running in a powershell. If you need to run any code, first create or edit the script in scripts/ folder, then run it next iteration with /run python scripts/myscript.py. Always update the memory bank area with current state so you will have the knowledge after we reset working memory and restart the script.

/architect Update any other documentation if major changes have been made that affects them.
