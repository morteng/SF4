### DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE! ###
/add automation\FIX_TESTS.aiderscript
/architect this has been a run of the script file FIX_TESTS.aiderscript. Given the results of this run, make any adits you need to the script file in preperation for the next run, changing only the section defined as editable (between editable area starts and editable area ends). If you need to run any console commands, prepend them with /run. This is a windows 10 machine, you are running in a powershell. If you need to run any code, first create the script in scripts/ folder, then run it next iteration with /run python scripts/myscript.py. 

/code Update the memory bank with any information you need in the next run, documenting current state. The memory context will reset before next iteration. Remove older memories from the memory bank that are no longer needed.

/reset
/load automation\FIX_TESTS.aiderscript
