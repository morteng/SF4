/ask How can we best implement Code Cycle Step 5 - Document, demo, and deploy? Objective: - Update all relevant documentation (README, DESIGN, PRD, PROGRESS, etc.) - Remove completed items from TODO - Prepare a demo and evaluate final deployment readiness - Decide if we are ready to demo to MANAGER. Any final tasks left?

/code Implement documentation updates.  - Remove old console commands from 10_CONSOLE_CMDS_5.txt  - Add any new commands needed to finalize the app before we demo to MNAGEMENT - Deploy for management review and approval by adding a "/run python app.py" command to the 12_RUN_APP.txt file if ready to get approval for deployment AND ALL TESTS ARE PASSING, all manager instructions have been followed. Push to GitHub when appropriate  - Remember: simple console commands only, write python scripts and run them when you need to.


# Step 5 over, go to 10_CONSOLE_CMDS_5.txt before final cleanup and possibly demo of app to Management
