/ask How can we best implement Code Cycle Step 5 - Document, demo, and deploy? Objective: - Update all relevant documentation (README, DESIGN, PRD, PROGRESS, etc.) - Remove completed items from TODO - Prepare a demo and evaluate final deployment readiness - Decide if we are ready to push to production. Any final tasks left?

/code Implement documentation updates.  - Remove old console commands from 10_CONSOLE_CMDS_5.txt  - Add any new commands needed to finalize or run the app  - Deploy for management review and approval by adding a "/run python app.py" command to the 10_CONSOLE_CMDS_5.txt file if ready to get approval for deployment. Push to GitHub when appropriate  - Remember: simple console commands only
