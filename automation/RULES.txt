Global Rules:
1. Do not run Python code directly with console commands; always create or update .py files, then /run python myscript.py them.
2. Add or remove console commands only by editing the indicated "EDITABLE AREA STARTS" and "EDITABLE AREA ENDS" sections.
3. Manager instructions have top priority.
4. Use /ask for reasoning or questions, /code for making code changes, and /architect for structural or top-level planning.
