Current Iteration: 49

Context: Resolving circular imports and configuration issues Known Issues:

• Circular import between routes/admin and common/utils viaBaseBlueprint
• Duplicate logging configuration in utils.py and logging_config.py
• Potential configuration validation gaps • Flask routes commandfailed due to config loading issue • Test import     
  error: No module named 'app.controllers.base_crud_controller'

Recent Changes:

• Moved BaseBlueprint to common/base_blueprint.py
• Consolidated logging configuration in logging_config.py
• Removed logging setup from utils.py

Next Steps:

• Verify circular import fix by running flask routes
• Test logging configuration consistency
• Implement configuration validation in config.py
• Check for any remaining circular dependencies
• Ensure all tests pass after changes
• Proceed with configuration cleanup
• Finalize controller consolidation
• Conduct full test suite verification
