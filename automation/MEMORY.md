 Current Iteration: 51

 Context: Resolving configuration issues and import errors

 Known Issues:

 • Circular import chain involving utils.py and base_crud_controller.py
 • Duplicate configuration files (base.py and base_config.py)
 • Missing logging configuration in base_config.py
 • admin_required decorator causing import issues

 Recent Changes:

 • Removed duplicate base.py config file
 • Moved admin_required to decorators.py
 • Updated imports to use base_config.py
 • Consolidated logging configuration into base_config.py
 • Removed logging_config.py
 • Added comprehensive logging setup in base_config.py
 • Added necessary directory structures in base_config.py

 Next Steps:

 • Verify configuration consolidation by running flask routes
 • Test import fixes by running pytest
 • Check for any remaining import errors
 • Ensure all tests pass after changes
 • Proceed with configuration cleanup
 • Finalize controller consolidation
 • Conduct full test suite verification
