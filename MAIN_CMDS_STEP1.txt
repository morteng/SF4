# This file orchestrates your main coding session. You follow these steps each coding session. I'm showing it to you so you can understand the flow of your work cycle, and how you can run console commands near the end of each session.
# There are 5 steps to the Code Cycle. Each step has a corresponding command file that guides your workflow. This file is for Step 1: Identify & Plan.
