# Planning & Progress Structure

## 1. High-Level Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Core Features**  
   - Set up Flask routes, define data models, and implement basic TDD structure.  
   - Provide initial UI for stipend discovery with tag-based filtering.

2. **Phase 2: Automation & Admin Tools**  
   - Develop automated bots for tagging, updates, and validations.  
   - Enhance the admin interface with complete CRUD functionality and robust security measures.

3. **Phase 3: Production Readiness**  
   - Integrate database backup scripts, finalize semantic versioning, and establish a reliable release process.  
   - Conduct thorough performance testing and security reviews.

## 2. Milestone Breakdown

| Milestone                | Tasks                                                               | Status        |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **M1 – MVP**            | Initial Flask setup, database models, and TDD test harness           | In Progress  |
| **M2 – Admin Interface** | Complete admin CRUD, add authentication, refine tests               | Planned      |
| **M3 – Automated Bots**  | Implement tagging and update bots, integrate validations            | Planned      |
| **M4 – Production**      | Database backups, log management, and final release packaging        | Planned      |

## 3. Sprint & Task Organization

- **User Stories**  
  - “As an admin, I need the ability to quickly create and update stipends so that new opportunities are readily available to users.”  
  - “As a user, I want to filter stipends by tags so I can find the most relevant opportunities.”

- **Branching Strategy**  
  - Use `feature/<short_description>` branches for new functionalities.  
  - Merge via pull requests that include relevant tests and a clear summary of changes.

## 4. Risk & Mitigation

- **Risk**: Delays or instability due to incomplete testing.  
  - **Mitigation**: Adhere strictly to TDD, maintain comprehensive reviews, and ensure small, focused pull requests.  
- **Risk**: Potential data or configuration issues during production deployment.  
  - **Mitigation**: Thoroughly test Alembic migrations in a staging environment, maintain regular backups, and follow a structured release process.
