# This file orchestrates your main coding session. You follow these steps each coding session. I'm showing it to you so you can understand the flow of your work cycle, and how you can run console commands near the end of each session.



# Step 2: Test & Debug
/run flask routes
/test
/ask If tests fail, what's causing the issue?
/architect implement fixes
/test





# Step 3: Refine & Summarize
/ask Should we revisit or refactor any code? Summarize the current status.
/architect implement improvements

# Step 4: Optional Additional Checks
/run flask routes
/test
/ask If there's a new issue, what is it?

# Step 5: Final Documentation Updates
/code Update TODO.txt with final changes & findings, important info and things we've learned that would be good to remember next coding session.

# Step 6: Remove previous console commands from CONSOLE_CMDS.txt and add any new ones that will be run next. 
/add CONSOLE_CMDS.txt
/code Remove any previously executed console commands from previos coding session from CONSOLE_CMDS.txt, add new ones that will be run next if needed.
