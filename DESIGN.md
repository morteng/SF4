# Design Documentation

## 1. Architectural Overview
- **Frontend**: Primarily HTML, CSS, and HTMX for partial page updates.  
- **Backend**: Flask-based application with SQLAlchemy for data access and Alembic for database migrations.  
- **TDD Approach**: Emphasis on test-driven development to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## 2. Data Model
- **Stipend**: Represents each funding opportunity (fields may include `id`, `name`, `description`, `tags`).  
- **Tag**: Represents tags (fields may include `id`, `name`), typically in a many-to-many relationship with Stipend.  
- **Organization**: Represents the sponsoring entity for each stipend.

## 3. Module Structure
- **Routes (`routes/`)**: Contains endpoint definitions (e.g., `admin_routes.py`, `user_routes.py`).  
- **Models (`models/`)**: Includes ORM classes for `Stipend`, `Tag`, `Organization`, etc.  
- **Services (`services/`)**: Houses business logic for stipend management, tagging, data validation bots, and so forth.  

## 4. Security & Authentication
- Restrict administrative routes to authenticated users.  
- Implement proper error handling and logging for security-related events.

## 5. Error Handling and Logging
- **Try/Except Blocks**: Capture exceptions and respond with standardized error messages.  
- **Logging**: Maintain consistent logs for debugging, stored securely and archived periodically.

## 6. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Validate core logic and utility functions.  
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure correct interaction among routes, services, and the database.  
- **End-to-End Tests**: Confirm user flows function as expected, from login to stipend discovery.  
- **Coverage**: Maintains 82% coverage with comprehensive test verification
- **Deployment Verification**: Includes pre-deployment and post-deployment checks
- **Security Testing**: Validates environment variables and secret management
