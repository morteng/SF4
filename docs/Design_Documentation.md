# Design Documentation

## 1. Architectural Overview
- **Frontend**: Primarily HTML, CSS, and HTMX for partial page updates.
- **Backend**: Flask-based application with SQLAlchemy for ORM and Alembic for migrations.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Emphasis on unit and integration testing to ensure reliability.

## 2. Data Model
- **Stipend**  
  - Represents a funding opportunity with fields like `id`, `name`, `description`, and `tags`.
  - Only `name` field is required - other fields can be populated later by AI bot.
- **Tag**  
  - Represents a tag (e.g., `id`, `name`) in a many-to-many relationship with Stipend.
- **Organization**  
  - Represents the sponsoring entity for each stipend.

## 3. Module Structure
- **Routes (`routes/`)**  
  Defines endpoint logic, e.g., `admin_routes.py`, `user_routes.py`.
- **Models (`models/`)**  
  Contains ORM classes for `Stipend`, `Tag`, `Organization`, etc.
- **Services (`services/`)**  
  Houses business logic for stipend management, tagging, data validation, and more.

## 4. Security & Authentication
- **Administrative Access**: Restrict administrative routes to authenticated users.
- **Logging & Error Handling**: Implement secure logging of security-related events and standardized error responses.

## 5. Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Validate core logic (services, models).
- **Integration Tests**: Verify correct interaction among routes, services, and DB.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Confirm user flows (e.g., logging in, filtering stipends) function as expected.
- **Coverage Target**: Maintain at least **80%** code coverage overall.

## 6. Logging & Backups
- **Logging**: Standard, centralized logs for debugging and auditing with proper rotation and archiving
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated database backups with retention policy and integrity checks
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data (e.g., credentials) securely, verified at runtime
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive production monitoring with alert thresholds
