# Development Log - Cycle 84 - 2025-01-14 🚀
- Cycle time: 0:05:23 ⏱️
- Test coverage: 85% 📊 (target: 85%)

## Key Accomplishments 🏆
- Completed schema migration for tags column type
- Verified database connection remains stable
- Executed resource cleanup successfully
- Established schema migration testing framework

## Lessons Learned 📚
- Schema migrations require careful testing
- Database connections must be verified after migrations
- Cleanup process is essential after schema changes
- Migration documentation is critical for future maintenance

## Current Vibe 🎭
"Schema migration complete but testing needs attention" ✅⚠️

## Key Challenges 🚧
- Resolving test environment configuration issues
- Ensuring all tests pass after schema changes
- Maintaining database performance during migrations
- Documenting migration process thoroughly

## Wins 🏆
- Successful tags column type migration
- Stable database connection throughout process
- Cleanup process completed without issues
- Migration framework established for future changes

## Next Steps 🗺️
1. Fix test environment configuration
2. Add comprehensive migration tests
3. Document schema migration process
4. Implement schema version tracking
5. Create rollback procedures

## Developer Notes 📝
"The schema migration for the tags column type was completed successfully, but we encountered test environment configuration issues that need to be resolved. The database connection remained stable throughout the process, and the cleanup process worked as expected. We need to focus on improving our test coverage for schema migrations and documenting the process thoroughly." - Lead Developer
