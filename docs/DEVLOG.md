# Development Log - Cycle 73 - 2025-01-14 🚀
- Cycle time: 0:12:45 ⏱️
- Test coverage: Not measured 📊 (target: 85%)

## Key Accomplishments 🏆
- Completed database verification cycle
- Fixed path configuration issues
- Identified missing columns in stipend schema
- Cleaned up resources successfully
- Improved error handling for database operations

## Lessons Learned 📚
- Schema validation needs more robust testing
- Path configuration must be verified before other operations
- Resource cleanup is essential between cycles
- Database connection errors need better isolation
- Import errors can cascade through the system

## Current Vibe 🎭
"Database issues identified, ready for fixes" 🔧

## Key Challenges 🚧
- Missing columns in stipend table (tags)
- Database connection import errors
- Schema validation failures
- Need better isolation of verification steps

## Wins 🏆
- Path configuration working reliably
- Resource cleanup implemented
- Verification cycle completed
- Error handling improved

## Next Steps 🗺️
1. Fix missing columns in stipend schema
2. Resolve database connection import errors
3. Enhance schema validation
4. Isolate verification steps better
5. Add more robust error handling

## Developer Notes 📝
"Verification cycle identified several database issues that need immediate attention. The missing columns in stipend table and connection import errors are top priorities. Next cycle should focus on fixing these schema and connection issues." - Lead Developer
