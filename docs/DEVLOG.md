# Development Log - Cycle 101 - 2025-01-26 🚀
- Cycle time: 0:05:25 ⏱️
- Test coverage: (No significant change this cycle) 📊
- Security audit: (Not re-run this cycle)
- Database schema: PARTIALLY VALIDATED (Initial error fixed, but still investigating)
- Monitoring: ACTIVE
- Critical fixes:
  - SQLAlchemy `PRAGMA table_info` error resolved in schema verification ✅
  - `TypeError` in user model test fixed by correcting User model initialization ✅
- Key achievement: Basic user model test now running (though may still fail) 🚀
- System status: Undergoing stabilization and debugging 🐛

## Final Pre-Deployment Checks
- [ ] Database migration validation
- [ ] Security context hardening
- [ ] Monitoring integration
- [x] Documentation updates (this DEVLOG entry)

## Post-Deployment Priorities
1. Performance benchmarking
2. User documentation overhaul
3. Feedback system implementation
- Critical fixes:
  - SQLite migration reliability (Ongoing investigation)
  - Security limiter initialization (Not addressed this cycle)
  - Production config validation (Not addressed this cycle)
- Key improvements:
  - Debugging script for schema verification implemented ✅
  - Test execution stability improved (User model test now runs) ✅
  - Corrected pytest filter for user model tests ✅
- Remaining tasks:
  - Fully resolve database schema validation errors 📝
  - Ensure all tests pass consistently 📊
  - Investigate and remove duplicate logging ⚙️

## Test Coverage Analysis 📊
### Coverage Improvements:
- (No significant coverage improvements this cycle - focus was on debugging)

### Coverage Gaps:
- (Coverage gaps remain as previously identified)

### Test Execution:
- Total tests: (To be determined after tests are fully passing)
- Errors: (To be determined after tests are fully passing)
- Failures: (To be determined after tests are fully passing)
- Coverage: (No significant change this cycle)

## Key Accomplishments 🏆
- Resolved SQLAlchemy `PRAGMA` error in schema verification
- Fixed `TypeError` in user model test
- Improved test execution by correcting pytest filter

## Lessons Learned 📚
- Precise SQLAlchemy syntax is crucial, especially for SQLite raw queries.
- Test function names and pytest filters must match exactly.
- Careful examination of error messages and code is essential for debugging.

## Next Steps 🗺️
1. Fully resolve database schema validation errors
2. Ensure all tests pass consistently
3. Investigate and remove duplicate logging
4. Proceed to full test suite execution and coverage verification

## Current Vibe 🎭
"Making progress on stability - tests are starting to run, but still need to ensure they pass and resolve schema validation fully." 🚧🐛
