# Development Log - Cycle 74 - 2025-01-14 🚀
- Cycle time: 0:15:30 ⏱️
- Test coverage: Not measured 📊 (target: 85%)

## Key Accomplishments 🏆
- Successfully initialized database connection
- Verified path configuration is working
- Completed resource cleanup
- Identified critical schema issues (missing tags column)
- Pinpointed import error in verify_db_connection

## Lessons Learned 📚
- Database initialization needs better error handling
- Import dependencies must be carefully managed
- Schema verification is critical before operations
- Resource cleanup helps prevent cascading errors
- Path configuration must be verified early

## Current Vibe 🎭
"Database connection established, but schema issues remain" 🔍

## Key Challenges 🚧
- Missing tags column in stipend table
- Import error in verify_db_connection
- Dependency chain issues in verification scripts
- Need better error handling for initialization

## Wins 🏆
- Database connection established
- Path configuration verified
- Cleanup completed successfully
- Specific issues identified for next cycle

## Next Steps 🗺️
1. Fix missing tags column in stipend schema
2. Resolve verify_db_connection import error
3. Improve database initialization error handling
4. Verify all verification script dependencies
5. Add schema validation before operations

## Developer Notes 📝
"While we have a working database connection, several critical issues remain. The missing tags column and verify_db_connection import error are top priorities. Next cycle should focus on fixing these schema and dependency issues." - Lead Developer
