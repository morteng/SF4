# Development Log - Cycle 71 - 2025-01-14 🚀
- Cycle time: 0:04:29 ⏱️
- Test coverage: Not measured 📊 (target: 85%)

## Key Accomplishments 🏆
- Resolved database connection issues
- Fixed schema verification failures
- Improved path configuration
- Completed database initialization cycle
- Enhanced verification scripts

## Lessons Learned 📚
- Proper path configuration is crucial for imports
- Database connection pooling improves reliability
- Schema verification should include version tracking
- Automated testing prevents regression

## Current Vibe 🎭
"Database foundations solid, ready to build" 🏗️

## Key Challenges 🚧
- Need for better error handling
- Lack of database monitoring
- No backup/restore system
- Schema version tracking needed

## Wins 🏆
- Database connection issues resolved
- Schema verification working
- Path configuration improved
- Initialization cycle completed

## Next Steps 🗺️
1. Implement proper error handling
2. Add comprehensive logging
3. Create backup/restore scripts
4. Add schema version tracking
5. Implement database monitoring

## Developer Notes 📝
"Cycle successfully resolved database connection and schema verification issues. The foundation is now stable enough to focus on reliability and monitoring features. Next cycle should implement error handling and logging before moving to backup/restore functionality." - Lead Developer
