# Development Log - Cycle 76 - 2025-01-14 🚀
- Cycle time: 0:21:10 ⏱️
- Test coverage: Not measured 📊 (target: 85%)

## Key Accomplishments 🏆
- Identified database connection failures
- Detected missing validate_db_connection import
- Confirmed missing tags column in stipend table
- Verified path configuration is working
- Completed resource cleanup successfully

## Lessons Learned 📚
- Database connection issues need immediate attention
- Import dependencies require better organization
- Schema validation must run before operations
- Path configuration is stable and reliable
- Cleanup scripts are working as expected

## Current Vibe 🎭
"Database issues identified, ready for fixes" 🔧

## Key Challenges 🚧
- Database connection failures
- Missing validate_db_connection import
- Missing tags column in stipend table
- Dependency chain issues in verification scripts

## Wins 🏆
- Path configuration working correctly
- Resource cleanup completed successfully
- Specific database issues identified
- Schema verification working as expected

## Next Steps 🗺️
1. Fix database connection issues
2. Add missing validate_db_connection import
3. Add missing tags column to stipend schema
4. Verify all verification script dependencies
5. Improve error handling for database operations

## Developer Notes 📝
"The database verification cycle successfully identified critical connection and schema issues. Next cycle should focus on fixing the database connection and adding the missing tags column." - Lead Developer
