# Development Log - Cycle 75 - 2025-01-14 🚀
- Cycle time: 0:18:45 ⏱️
- Test coverage: Not measured 📊 (target: 85%)

## Key Accomplishments 🏆
- Verified database schema issues (missing tags column)
- Completed path configuration verification
- Executed successful resource cleanup
- Confirmed database connection issues
- Identified import dependency problems

## Lessons Learned 📚
- Schema verification must run before database operations
- Import dependencies need better organization
- Path configuration is stable but needs monitoring
- Resource cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Database connection errors need better handling

## Current Vibe 🎭
"Schema issues identified, ready for fixes" 🔧

## Key Challenges 🚧
- Missing tags column in stipend table
- Database connection import errors
- Dependency chain issues in verification scripts
- Need better error handling for initialization

## Wins 🏆
- Schema verification working correctly
- Path configuration stable
- Cleanup completed successfully
- Specific schema issues identified

## Next Steps 🗺️
1. Add missing tags column to stipend schema
2. Fix verify_db_connection import errors
3. Improve database connection error handling
4. Verify all verification script dependencies
5. Add schema validation before operations

## Developer Notes 📝
"The schema verification cycle successfully identified the missing tags column as the critical issue. Next cycle should focus on fixing the schema and resolving the import dependency issues." - Lead Developer
