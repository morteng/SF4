# Development Log - Cycle 85 - 2025-01-14 🚀
- Cycle time: 0:03:37 ⏱️
- Test coverage: 85% 📊 (target: 85%)

## Key Accomplishments 🏆
- Fixed test environment configuration issues
- Verified schema migration tests pass successfully
- Completed resource cleanup
- Improved test coverage for schema migrations

## Lessons Learned 📚
- Proper Python path configuration is crucial for tests
- Test fixtures need to initialize all required extensions
- Schema verification should be part of test setup
- In-memory databases are useful for migration testing

## Current Vibe 🎭
"Schema migration tests passing - ready for next cycle!" ✅✅

## Key Challenges 🚧
- Resolving module import issues in test environment
- Ensuring proper extension initialization
- Verifying schema changes in test database
- Maintaining test isolation

## Wins 🏆
- Successful test environment configuration
- All schema migration tests passing
- Clean resource cleanup process
- Improved test reliability

## Next Steps 🗺️
1. Implement backup/restore cycle
2. Add database connection pooling
3. Create monitoring dashboard
4. Implement schema version tracking
5. Document test environment setup

## Developer Notes 📝
"The schema migration cycle completed successfully after resolving test environment configuration issues. The key was properly setting up the Python path and initializing extensions in the test fixtures. All migration tests are now passing, and we're ready to move on to implementing the backup/restore functionality." - Lead Developer
