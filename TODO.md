# TODO List
  1. Duplicate Code in Routes

The admin routes (bot_routes.py, stipend_routes.py, tag_routes.py, etc.) have very similar CRUD operations. For example:

 • Each route has create, edit, delete, and index endpoints.
 • The logic for handling forms, validation, and notifications is repeated.

Refactor Plan:

 • Create a BaseRouteController class to handle common CRUD operations.
 • Use inheritance to create specific route controllers for each entity.
 2. Duplicate Code in Services

The services (bot_service.py, stipend_service.py, tag_service.py, etc.) have similar CRUD methods.

Refactor Plan:

 • Use the existing BaseService class to handle common CRUD operations.
 • Ensure all services inherit from BaseService and only implement domain-specific logic.
 3. Duplicate Code in Tests

The test files (test_bot_service.py, test_stipend_service.py, etc.) have similar test cases for CRUD operations.

Refactor Plan:

 • Create a base test class with common test cases.
 • Inherit from the base class and add entity-specific tests.

## High Priority
- Fix failing tests
- Finish bot UI
- Improve scheduling

## Medium Priority
1. Add bot status monitoring
2. Implement bot error handling
3. Add bot execution history

## Low Priority
1. Implement actual bot functionality (TagBot, UpdateBot, ReviewBot)
2. Add bot performance metrics
3. Implement bot notifications
