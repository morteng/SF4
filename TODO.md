# Updated TODO List

## Completed
- [x] Fix circular imports by refactoring shared functionality into `app/common/utils.py`.
- [x] Add `__init__.py` to `app/forms` to make it a valid package.
- [x] Refactor `create_limit` into a proper property with a getter and setter.
- [x] Add a pre-test dependency verification script.
- [x] Install missing dependencies (`pytest`, `freezegun`, `Flask`).
- [x] Refactor `verify_dependencies()` to skip tests instead of failing the suite.
- [x] Fix `CustomDateTimeField` initialization to handle `validators` argument.

## Next Session
- [x] Fix `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytest'`

- [x] Verify all dependencies are installed
- [ ] Refactor shared functionality into `app/common/base_service.py` to avoid circular imports.
- [ ] Add a pre-test dependency verification script to ensure all required packages are installed.
- [ ] Verify that all properties are correctly implemented with `@property` and `@<property>.setter`.
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for edge cases in date/time validation.
- [ ] Ensure all error messages are centralized in `app/constants.py` and used consistently.

## Long Term
