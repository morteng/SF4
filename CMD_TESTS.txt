# --------------------------------------
# This file orchestrates your coding session and any console commands
# you need to run, all in one place. You are currently running inside an activated venv with all dependencies from requirements.txt already installed. IMPORTANT! you are only allowed to edit the console commands section of this document - NEVER alter any other part of the loop.

### PENDING CONSOLE COMMANDS ###
# Add any new console commands below with /run prefix and remove them after theyâ€™re executed
# Example:
# /run echo "Hello from the console!"

### MAIN CODING SESSION ###

/git add .
/commit

/read PROJECT.md
/read CONVENTIONS.md
/read VALIDATION.md
/add TODO.md

/run flask routes
/test

# Step 1: Identify & Plan
/ask Based on TODO.md (and other docs), how do we address the issues?
/architect implement the suggested changes

# Step 2: Test & Debug
/run flask routes
/test
/ask If tests fail, what's causing the issue?
/architect implement fixes
/test

# Step 3: Refine & Summarize
/ask Should we revisit or refactor any code? Summarize the current status.
/architect implement improvements
/test

# Step 4: Optional Additional Checks
/run flask routes
/ask If there's a new issue, what is it?

/add CMD_TESTS.md

# Step 5: Final Documentation Updates
/architect update TODO.md with final changes & findings, important info and things we've learned that would be good to remember next coding session. Remove the console commands that were run from the Pending console commands section of CMD_TESTS.txt file (this document). Add any new console commands to be run at start of next coding session, if needed. DO NOT CHANGE ANY OTHER SECTIONS.


# End of main coding session
/reset

# start new coding session
/load CMD_TESTS.txt
