/ask Are there any untracked files or changes that need to be addressed before proceeding?

# Step 1: Identify & Plan
/ask Based on TODO.md, PROJECT.md, and VALIDATION.md, what are the highest-priority tasks?
/architect Propose a detailed plan for implementing the changes, including validation and error handling.

# Step 2: Implement & Validate
/code Implement the planned changes, ensuring they follow CONVENTIONS.md and VALIDATION.md.
/test Run tests to verify the changes, focusing on edge cases and error handling.

# Step 3: Debug & Refine

/code Fix the issues, ensuring proper error messages and rollback mechanisms are in place.
/test Re-run tests to confirm the fixes.

# Step 4: Review & Document
/ask Should any code be refactored for better maintainability or performance?
/architect Update PROJECT.md, CONVENTIONS.md, and VALIDATION.md with any new patterns or findings.
/commit Commit the changes with a descriptive message.

# Step 5: Final Checks
/run flask routes
/ask Are there any new issues or unexpected behavior in the routes?
