# For managing third-party dependencies

# 1) Bring relevant files into context
/add meta_cycles/manager_instructions.txt

# 2) Analyze dependency needs
/ask Based on manager_instructions.txt, what dependency updates or changes should we make? Please outline the approach.

# 3) Implement dependency changes
/code Update requirements.txt and pyproject.toml with the suggested changes

# 4) Run dependency checks
/run pip install -r requirements.txt --dry-run

# 5) If checks fail, suggest fixes
/ask Did dependency check fail? Suggest fixes.
/code implement suggested dependency improvements.

# Go to cleanup
/load meta_cycles/finalize_cycle.aiderscript
