# For cleaning up project references and verifying transitions

# 1) Bring relevant files into context
/add meta_cycles/manager_instructions.txt
/add meta_cycles/00_documentation.md
/add meta_cycles/metrics_collector.py

# 2) Analyze cleanup needs
/ask Based on manager_instructions.txt, what cleanup tasks should we perform? Please identify any remaining "myproject" references and verify cycle transitions.

# 3) Implement cleanup changes
/code Update all files to remove "myproject" references and verify cycle transitions

# 4) Verify pytest is installed
/ask Is pytest installed? If not, suggest the command to install it.

# 5) Run tests to verify changes
/run pytest --maxfail=1 || echo "Tests failed or pytest not found"

# 6) Analyze test results
/code Please analyze the test results and suggest any needed cleanup improvements. Include specific file changes needed.

# 7) Implement cleanup improvements
/code implement suggested cleanup improvements.

# 8) Verify cleanup
/code Please verify all cleanup tasks are complete and no "myproject" references remain.

# 9) Verify documentation needs
/code Based on 02_TODO.txt and 01_manager_instructions.txt, what documentation updates are needed? Should we proceed to documentation_cycle next?
