# bugfix_cycle.aiderscript
# update this as needed, always end with going to cleanup.

# 1) Bring the buggy files into context
/add ../myproject/code/buggy_file.py

# 2) Ask for approach, then code changes
/ask We have a bug in buggy_file.py. Please outline how to fix it effectively.
/code Implement your suggested bug fix in buggy_file.py

# 3) Run tests
/run pytest --maxfail=1

# 4) If tests pass, let's move to finalize. We'll do so by editing this script or just printing a line
/ask Did test fail? Suggest fixes.
/code implement suggested code changes.

# Go to cleanup
/load meta_cycles/finalize_cycle.aiderscript
