# For profiling and performance optimization

# 1) Bring relevant files into context
/add meta_cycles/manager_instructions.txt
/add ../myproject/code/performance_critical.py
/add ../myproject/profiling_results.txt

# 2) Analyze performance needs
/ask Based on manager_instructions.txt, what performance profiling and optimizations should we perform? Please outline the approach.

# 3) Implement performance improvements
/code Update performance_critical.py with the suggested optimizations

# 4) Run performance tests
/run python -m cProfile -o profiling_results.txt performance_critical.py

# 5) If performance issues found, suggest fixes
/ask Did profiling reveal performance bottlenecks? Suggest fixes.
/code implement suggested performance improvements.

# Go to cleanup
/load meta_cycles/finalize_cycle.aiderscript
