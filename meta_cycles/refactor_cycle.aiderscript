# For improving code structure and quality without changing functionality

# 1) Bring relevant files into context
/add meta_cycles/manager_instructions.txt
/add ../myproject/code/refactor_file.py

# 2) Analyze refactoring needs
/ask Based on manager_instructions.txt, what refactoring improvements should we make to refactor_file.py? Please outline the approach.

# 3) Implement refactoring changes
/code Update refactor_file.py with the suggested improvements

# 4) Run tests to verify changes
/run pytest --maxfail=1

# 5) If tests fail, suggest fixes
/ask Did test fail? Suggest fixes.
/code implement suggested refactoring improvements.

# Go to cleanup
/load meta_cycles/finalize_cycle.aiderscript
