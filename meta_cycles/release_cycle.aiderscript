# For managing versioning and release notes

# 1) Bring relevant files into context
/add meta_cycles/manager_instructions.txt
/add ../myproject/CHANGELOG.md
/add ../myproject/version.txt

# 2) Analyze release needs
/ask Based on manager_instructions.txt, what version update and release notes should we prepare? Please outline the approach.

# 3) Implement release updates
/code Update CHANGELOG.md and version.txt with the suggested changes

# 4) Run release checks
/run python -c "import semver; print(semver.VersionInfo.parse(open('version.txt').read().strip()))"

# 5) If checks fail, suggest fixes
/ask Did version check fail? Suggest fixes.
/code implement suggested release improvements.

# Go to cleanup
/load meta_cycles/finalize_cycle.aiderscript
