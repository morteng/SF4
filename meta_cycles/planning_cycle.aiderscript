# For initial project setup and requirements gathering

# 1) Bring relevant files into context
/add meta_cycles/01_manager_instructions.txt
/add meta_cycles/02_TODO.txt
/add meta_cycles/00_documentation.md

# 2) Analyze project requirements
/ask Based on the current manager instructions and TODO list, what are the key requirements and architecture decisions we need to make? Please outline the approach.

# 3) Create initial project structure
/code Update 00_documentation.md with the suggested architecture and requirements
/code Update 02_TODO.txt with initial tasks and milestones
/code Update 01_manager_instructions.txt with any new requirements or clarifications

# 4) Determine next cycle
/ask Based on the manager instructions and TODO list, we need to implement metrics tracking next. Please confirm this is the correct next step.

# 5) Update chooser with metrics cycle
/code Update meta_cycles/chooser.aiderscript to load meta_cycles/metrics_cycle.aiderscript

# 6) Go to cleanup
/load meta_cycles/finalize_cycle.aiderscript
