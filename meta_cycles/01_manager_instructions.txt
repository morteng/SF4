# Updated Manager Instructions - 2025-01-14

MOST IMPORTANT RULE: You must avoid endless code cycle lopps, always chain code cycles together properly starting with start.aiderscript, chooser.aiderscri pt, one or more code cycle aiderscripts and finally finalize_cycle.aiderscript that cleans up the cycle, resets context memory and starts the process all over again. 

## Current Status
- Database initialization cycle implemented
- Basic verification scripts in place
- Logging and path configuration working
- Database connection issues identified

## Next Steps
1. Focus on resolving database connection errors
2. Implement proper error handling for database operations
3. Add comprehensive logging for database operations
4. Create database backup/restore scripts

## Implementation Notes
- Continue using single-line /ask and /code prompts
- Maintain clear cycle documentation
- Focus on database stability before proceeding with other features
- Keep DEVLOG updated with progress and issues
