# Updated Manager Instructions - 2025-01-14

Important! No need to split cycle files up, like wit backup_restore_cycle.aiderscript just add all steps to it before the last /load command.

If you need to update the database schema then also create and run a script that actually performs the migration and upgrade.

Get all the tests working!

IMPORTANT! There can only be one /load directive at end of a code cycle file! If you have two, the second one will never execute.

start.aiderscript should always move on to chooser.aidersctipt.

MOST IMPORTANT RULE: You must avoid endless code cycle loops, always chain code cycles together properly starting with start.aiderscript, chooser.aiderscript, one or more code cycle aiderscripts and finally finalize_cycle.aiderscript that cleans up the cycle, resets context memory and starts the process all over again. 

## Current Status
- Database connection and schema verification working reliably
- Comprehensive error handling implemented
- Enhanced logging system in place
- Path configuration stable

## Next Steps
1. Implement database backup/restore system
2. Add connection pooling for better performance
3. Create monitoring dashboard for database metrics
4. Implement schema version tracking

## Implementation Notes
- Continue using single-line /ask and /code prompts
- Maintain clear cycle documentation
- Focus on database reliability and performance
- Keep DEVLOG updated with progress and issues
- Add automated testing for backup/restore operations
