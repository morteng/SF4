- Updated test database initialization  
- Finalized documentation  

## Next Steps 🗺️
1. Fix version management test failures  
2. Complete production environment verification  
3. Resolve deployment file verification issues  
4. Improve test coverage to meet 80% target  
5. Add missing deployment files  
6. Finalize version bump logic  

## Developer Notes 📝
"While we've made good progress, several critical issues remain that prevent deployment. The team needs to focus on version management, production verification, and test coverage improvements before we can safely deploy." - Lead Developer
