# Coding Conventions Guideline

## 1. Environment & Dependencies
    
- **Requirements**:  
  - Keep dependencies in `requirements.txt`.  

- **Pre-Test Verification**:  
  python
  def test_dependencies():
      try:
          subprocess.check_call(["pip", "install", "-r", "requirements.txt"])
      except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
          pytest.fail("Failed to install dependencies")
  
  (Skips tests gracefully if something’s missing—no meltdown required.)

## 2. Testing Setup

### Test Organization
- **Folder Structure**:
  ```
  tests/
    auth/        # Authentication tests (login, logout, registration)
    models/      # Model tests (database models and relationships)
    routes/      # Route tests (endpoint functionality)
    services/    # Service tests (business logic)
    fixtures/    # Test fixtures (shared test data)
    integration/ # Integration tests (cross-module functionality)
  ```
  
- **File Naming**:
  - Test files: `test_<module>_<functionality>.py`
    Example: `test_auth_login.py`, `test_user_model.py`
  
- **Test Function Naming**:
  - `test_<scenario>[_when_<condition>]`
    Example: `test_login_success`, `test_login_fails_when_invalid_credentials`
  
- **Fixtures**:
  - Place shared fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`
  - Name fixtures descriptively: `<scope>_<fixture_name>`
    Example: `user_factory`, `client_with_csrf`
  
- **Best Practices**:
  - Keep tests focused on single functionality
  - Use clear, descriptive test names
  - Group related tests in the same file
  - Use fixtures for shared test setup
  - Clean up test data after each test
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Test files: `test_<module>_<functionality>.py`
  - Test functions: `test_<scenario>`
  - Fixtures: `<scope>_<fixture_name>`
  
- **pytest**   
- **freezegun**: For controlling date/time in tests.


## 3. Custom Field Implementation
- **Handle All Arguments**: If you create a `CustomDateTimeField`, accept all typical field arguments.
- **Default Validators**: If `validators` is `None`, default to `[InputRequired()]`.
  
  if validators is None:
      validators = [InputRequired()]
  
- **Usage**: Avoid passing in the `validators` argument again unless it’s truly necessary.

## 4. Property Implementation
- **@property** before `@<property>.setter`:  
  
  @property
  def create_limit(self):
      return self._create_limit

  @create_limit.setter
  def create_limit(self, value):
      self._create_limit = value
  
- **No Direct `_attribute` Access**: Keep logic consistent (and your code less feral).

- **Docstrings**: Because future you will forget what that property was for.

## 5. Circular Imports
- **Refactor Shared Logic**: Dump it into `common/utils.py` or something equally central.  
- **Lazy Imports**: Import from dependent modules inside functions if you must. That way your code doesn’t eat itself alive.

## 6. Validation Best Practices
- **General**: Verify input types before applying any fancy logic.  
- **Date/Time**:  
  - Validate date/time components individually.  
  - Watch for leap-year shenanigans.  
  - Use `freezegun` to test predictable moments in time.  
- **Error Messages**: Centralize in `app/constants.py` so you don’t sprinkle random strings all over.
- **CSRF Tokens**:
  - Always include CSRF tokens in test requests
  - Use `client.get('/')` to fetch CSRF token before POST requests
  - Validate CSRF tokens in all form submissions
- **Route Registration**:
  - Register admin routes before public routes
  - Use debug logging to verify route registration order
  - Test route accessibility after registration

## 7. Error Handling & Organization
- **Centralized Errors**: Single source of truth for messages, making your logs (and your sanity) that much better.
- **Graceful Fails**: If a package is missing, skip the test. Don’t throw the entire test suite off the cliff.  
- **Modular Code**: Minimal duplication, maximum reusability. Keep your code as neat as your desk (or neater, sir).

## Route Naming Conventions

1. **Blueprint Names**:
   - Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., `admin_stipend_bp`).

2. **Endpoint Names**:
   - Use lowercase with dots (e.g., `admin_stipend.create`).

3. **URL Prefixes**:
   - Use consistent prefixes for related routes (e.g., `/admin/stipends`).

## 8. use newest versions of all moduels and libraries
- **Up-to-date**: Keep your modules and libraries up-to-date to ensure you're using the latest features and security patches. Ensure requirements.txt reflects the latest versions of all dependencies.

## 9. About This Environment

- **Virtual Environment**:  
  You are currently running on a windows machine inside an activated venv with all dependencies from requirements.txt already installed.

- **TODO.txt**:  
  A file to keep track of tasks, ideas, or anything that needs to be addressed later. It's a simple text file where you can jot down notes, reminders, or to-dos. You can use it to capture ideas, brainstorm, or plan your work. It's a flexible tool that allows you to organize your thoughts and keep track of your tasks in a simple and accessible format. Periodically review and compress this file if it gets too big.

- **autocoder**:  
  You are running in a coding cycle with five steps. you can execute console commands between steps. Plan and act accordingly, don't do too much in one go, you can always come back to it and continue next cycle:

  **Step 1: Identify & Plan**  
  - Read your project details (TODOs, conventions, validations).  
  - Decide what to tackle and how.  
  - Potentially run any step-specific console commands (like migrations) before moving on.

  **Step 2: Test & Debug**  
  - Run your tests to see what breaks.  
  - Fix those issues based on the test feedback.  
  - If you need extra console commands to help debug, run them here.

  **Step 3: Refine & Summarize**  
  - Do some final polishing (refactoring, reorganizing, etc.).  
  - Summarize the current state of the code so you know exactly where you stand.

  **Step 4: Optional Additional Checks**  
  - Perform housekeeping: extra tests, coverage checks, or final quality gates.  
  - If new issues pop up, fix them here. Run console commands if needed.

  **Step 5: Final Documentation Updates**  
  - Update TODO.txt or any project docs with what you changed, how you fixed it, and why.  
  - Then either wrap up or reset to start the next cycle.
